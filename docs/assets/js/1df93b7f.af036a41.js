I've been using Nx pretty much from its beginnings to build a large and complex SaaS application (we have over 1200 libraries at this point).

Even worse, my colleagues who were not so familiar with the tooling had to often ask for my help to get things done."),o.createElement("p",null,"So the greatest impact my work could have on my daily engineering life as well as that of my colleagues was to provide a super simple, inclusive and maintainable way to get my knowledge about our workspace and tooling into the repository somehow.

This way, every developer benefits from the knowledge of each other developer and can perform all sorts of tasks without having to know each detail of the process (e.g., deploying a new version, creating a database in AWS, ...)."),o.createElement("p",null,"Anyways, here's the vision for this open-source project: build your own CLI to make your terminal life easier each day! You are probably wondering why there are many videos of a working Nx shell version, but no source-code yet. This is because I learned the hard way that one should first see whether an idea generates any interest before diving into the code. Many times nobody cares about your idea or understands it, even though you think it's super cool. I already have hundres of thousands of lines of code sitting there for the current version of Nx shell, but it would be a lot of work to make that code portable, split it up into multiple plugin packages on npm, establish contribution guidelines and so on. So this page is my way to find out whether enough of you Nrwlians out there care enough for Nx shell to exist in the world, otherwise it's probably not worth putting in the time. You can show your support by leaving a GitHub star, a follow on Twitter or your e-mail address, whatever you are most comfortable with. Once enough people show their interest, I will be more than happy to dedicate my free time to migrate the existing code into the open-source project."),o.createElement("p",null,"Yours truly,",o.createElement("br",null),"Ben")),o.createElement("div",{className:"row",style:{paddingLeft:"36px",paddingBottom:"36px"}},o.createElement("div",{className:"avatar"},o.createElement("img",{className:"avatar__photo avatar__photo--xl",src:(0,s.Z)("/img/profile_500px.jpg")}),o.createElement("div",{className:"avatar__intro"},o.createElement("div",{className:"avatar__name"},o.createElement("a",{href:"https://twitter.com/derbenoo",target:"_blank"},"Ben")),o.createElement("small",{className:"avatar__subtitle"},"Nrwlian")))))),o.createElement("section",null,o.createElement("div",{style:{position:"relative",marginTop:"-100px",zIndex:-1}},o.createElement("iframe",{src:"https://nxshell.substack.com/embed",width:"100%",height:"520",scrolling:"no",frameBorder:"0"}),o.createElement("div",{style:{position:"absolute",bottom:"0px",right:"0px",width:"200px",height:"100px",backgroundColor:"white"}}))))}},5459:(e,t,a)=>{a.d(t,{Z:()=>n});const n={heroBanner:"heroBanner_1Qg7",buttons:"buttons_1G9r",features:"features_1Oci",featureImage:"featureImage_3-9n"}}}]);
